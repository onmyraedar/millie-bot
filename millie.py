        As a digital artist, it can be incredibly frustrating when someone steals your work and tries to profit off of it.
        Thankfully, there's a law called the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) that can help you get your stolen content removed.
        Many websites have __online forms__ for submitting your DMCA takedown notice.
        If such a form doesn't exist, you can __contact the site's DMCA agent directly__ or __reach out to the web host or ISP__.

        Type **!email** to learn more about DMCA takedown emails.
        Type **!forms** for help with DMCA forms for a particular site.
